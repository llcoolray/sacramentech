When I first moved to the Sacramento area in 2015, I found it difficult to navigate the tech community and find the right position for me within it. Since that time, I've gained a great understanding of the local players and where some amazing local opportunities can be found.

Unfortunately, a central list of the amazing local companies in our region didn't exist. So, I decided to create it. My hope is that this can help the next generation of Sacramento talent find the job that makes them happiest and most successful in our city.

The Sacramento technology and creative communities are thriving! **You just need to know where to look**.

Cheers, Ray.
