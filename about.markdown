When I first moved to the Sacramento area in 2015, it was tough to navigate the tech community and find the right position within it. Since that time, I've gained a great understanding of the local players and where the opportunities are.

Unfortunately, a central list of the amazing local companies in Sac didn't exist. So, I decided to create it. My hope is that this can help the next generation of Sacramento talent find the job that makes them happiest and most successful in our city.

The Sacramento tech community is thriving! *You just need to know where to look*.
